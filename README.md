# WordToPDFConverter

Welocome to Word To PDf Converter 
This tool is totally free, it was developed by me
I tried to use many libraries to convert bulk of word files to pdf files such as (Spire.Doc) but it generated watermarks!!
so I found this helpful comment on StackOverflow link: https://stackoverflow.com/a/55334441 which guided me in developing this small application.

Have Fun!!
let's fight the repeated boring work!bye!
